# ECE710-instruction
## Scripts and results used for the machine learning instructional lectures of ECE 710 (Wearable Devices and IoT) at the University of Alberta that includes:
 - Model fitting and grid search optimizations for various machine learning models
   * Linear regression
   * Logistic regression
   * Decision tree
   * K-nearest neighbors
   * Random forest
   * Support vector machine
   * Artifical neural network
   * K-means clustering
   * Principal component analysis
 - Results visualization to illustrate concepts and provide insight on how to interpret the results
 - Common pre-processing techniques
 - Data exploration and results of three machine learning models (artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests) on a real-world wearable device data set
   * Task: Predict the type of activity (at home vs. sleeping vs. outside) given data from two wearable devices (Empatica: 3-axis accelerometer + heart rate; Hexoskin: 3-axis accelerometer + heart rate + respiratory rate)
